Questions

Please write a short response (4-5 sentences / short paragraph) to each of the following
questions / the following question. Your responses will be graded for accuracy, critical thinking,
and clarity. You may use any common word processing or text format. Please upload your
answers by the due date.

Question 1: GPT2 and T5 introduced similar ideas in the beginning of 2019. The key idea is
stated in the GPT2 paper: “the supervised objective is the same as the unsupervised objective,
but only evaluated on a subset of the sequence”. Explain what this means in your own words.

The big distinction between supervised and unsupervised learning are the presence of labels. Unsupervised learning has to learn with data which doesn't have labels (i.e. (x,)), and supervised learning gets to learn with the benefit of labeled outputs (i.e. (x,y)). The big idea introduced here is that, with the next token prediction objective, these two are actually the same objective, but with differently formatted data. For example, consider the string "The capital of Mali is Bamako". In the unsupervised setting, it has to predict "The" -> "capital", "The capital" -> "of", etc. In the supervised objective, we just have to make the data look like this:

"""
Question:

What is the capital of Mali?

Answer:

The capital of Mali is Bamako.
"""

This is definitively supervised (there's labels for the questions), and this example might be in the pretraining dataset (hence being a subset), but now it's predicting tokens like "Question:\n\nWhat is the capital of Mali?\n\nAnswer:\n The capital of Mali is" -> " Bamako". Therefore, it's the same objective as the unsupervised one, but with supervised data as the samples.
