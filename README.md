This is a monorepo for the course I took summer 2024 on large language models, my final course for my masters degree at JHU.

When this course concludes, I will unprivate this repo and it will be used exclusively for the content of my final project, which contains an investigation on multi-head latent attention. For now, I'm using this so I can effectively work on the course on multiple machines, since some of the homeworks can not really be completed on my laptop.
